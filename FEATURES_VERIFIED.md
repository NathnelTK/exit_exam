# Features verification summary

This file summarizes which features listed in `README.md` are present in the codebase, which are partially implemented, and which are missing. It was generated by scanning client and server code.

Summary
- Countdown Timer: IMPLEMENTED (client `CountdownTimer` component, used in `Dashboard`)
- Course Management: PARTIALLY (client `CourseList` exists; server `courses` route and `Course` model exist, but server/table lacks fields the client expects: `weight`, `difficulty`, `color`, and the API returns `id` while client expects `_id`.)
- Smart Study Planning (auto daily plan generation / regenerate endpoint): MISSING (client calls `/api/study-plans/regenerate` but no server route or planning algorithm implemented)
- Progress Tracking (daily tasks completion & minutes): PARTIALLY (client `DailyPlan` UI and PUT calls exist, but server `dailyTasks` route only has GET and POST — no PUT/UPDATE handler in routes or model)
- Daily Notifications: PARTIALLY (server has `notifications` route and `NotificationSubscription` model and a `notificationScheduler` util, but the scheduler code still uses Mongo-style queries and the client lacks subscription code to register push subscriptions)
- Theming / Customization: PARTIALLY (client supports customization UI; server now persists settings in `user_settings` via `UserSettings` model — added in a recent change)
- User authentication: IMPLEMENTED (server `auth` routes, `User` model, and JWT utilities exist; client has login/register pages)
- Responsive UI / real-time countdown: IMPLEMENTED (frontend components are present and countdown updates every second)
- Visual progress bars: IMPLEMENTED (client `DailyPlan` has a progress bar)
- Editable daily tasks: PARTIALLY (frontend supports editing `completedMinutes` and toggling completion and issues PUT requests; backend needs matching update endpoints)

Notes & recommended fixes
1. Courses schema mismatch
   - Client expects fields: `_id`, `weight`, `difficulty`, `color`.
   - Server `courses` table currently has: `id`, `name`, `description`, `userId`.
   - Recommendation: add columns `weight INTEGER`, `difficulty INTEGER`, `color TEXT` to `courses` table, and update `server/models/Course.js` to include those fields and return `_id` or adapt client to accept `id`.

2. Study plan generation endpoint
   - Client triggers `POST /api/study-plans/regenerate` after course changes, but no server route exists.
   - Recommendation: implement `/api/study-plans/regenerate` server route that runs the planning algorithm (distribute time proportional to weight × difficulty) and writes daily tasks into `daily_tasks` table.

3. Daily tasks update
   - Client issues `PUT /api/daily-tasks/:id` to toggle completion and update minutes; server route lacks PUT handler and `DailyTask` model lacks update method.
   - Recommendation: add `PUT /api/daily-tasks/:id` route and `DailyTask.update(id, updates)` model method.

4. Notifications scheduler
   - `server/utils/notificationScheduler.js` contains Mongo-style code (queries, populate, deleteOne). It will fail with current SQLite models.
   - Recommendation: rewrite the scheduler to use the SQLite models (use `UserSettings`, `DailyTask`, `NotificationSubscription` model methods) and ensure client subscribes to push (add service worker + subscription UI).

5. ID naming conventions
   - Frontend expects Mongo-style `_id` fields in many places. Backend uses `id` in models. You should standardize to one convention (I suggest returning objects with `_id` for compatibility or updating client code to use `id`).

Next actions I can take (pick any)
- Implement missing server endpoints: `/api/study-plans/regenerate`, `PUT /api/daily-tasks/:id`.
- Update `server/database.js` and `Course` model to add course columns (`weight`, `difficulty`, `color`) and migrate existing data.
- Rewrite `notificationScheduler` to work with SQLite models and/or add client subscription flow and service worker.
- Normalize response object IDs (`id` vs `_id`) across server responses and client expectations.

Status: verification completed. No README changes needed besides this verification file. If you want, I can implement the recommended fixes and push them.
